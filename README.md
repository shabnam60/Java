## Getting Started

### Basic concepts

* data types 
  * __Primitive__ (int,float,double,char,long,...)
  * __Classes__ (classes : Some data types are more complicated and contain an internal structure.  These are usually called classes.  Therefore, a class is nothing more than a fancy data type)
  
  ###### I use the term __variable__ or __object__ to refer to the memory location that holds the data. You can think of a variable or object as an entity that can take on different values as the program progresses

Variables are normally used to refer to instances of primitive data types while objects are used to refer to instances of complex data types (instances of classes).
